[Board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game "Board game") design is the development of rules and presentational aspects of a board game. When a player takes part in a game, it is the player's self-subjection to the rules that create a sense of purpose for the duration of the game. Maintaining the players' interest throughout the gameplay experience is the goal of board game design.
\n
To achieve this, board game designers emphasize different aspects such as social interaction, strategy, and competition, and target players of differing needs by providing for short versus long-play, and luck versus skill. Beyond this, board game design reflects the culture in which the board game is produced.

### Card games
[Card games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game) include games with cards that are custom-tailored to the game, as in many modern games, as well as those whose design is constricted by the type of the [deck of cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_of_cards "Deck of cards"), like [Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot "Tarot") or the [four-suited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(cards) "Suit (cards)") Latin decks. Card games can be played for fun, such as [Go Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Fish "Go Fish"), or as gambling games, such as [Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker "Poker").

### Dice games
[Dice games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_game "Dice game") are among the oldest known games and have often been associated with gambling. Non-gambling dice games, such as [Yatzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy "Yatzy"), [Poker dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_dice "Poker dice"), or [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee "Yahtzee") became popular in the mid-20th century.

### Role-playing games
The design of role-playing games requires the establishment of [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_setting "Campaign setting"), [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_creation "Character creation"), and basic [gameplay rules or mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system "Role-playing game system"). After a role-playing game is produced, additional design elements are often devised by the players themselves. In many instances, for example, [character creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_creation "Character creation") is left to the players. Likewise, the progression of a role-playing game is determined in large part by the [gamemaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster "Gamemaster") whose individual campaign design may be directed by one of several [role-playing game theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_theory).
